## Exploratory Analysis

We tackled these key questions:

1. **Which establishments have a hygiene score of 20?**
   - Identified and analyzed top establishments with excellent hygiene.

2. **Which establishments in London have a `RatingValue â‰¥ 4`?**
   - Queried high-rated establishments in London.

3. **What are the top 5 establishments closest to Penang Flavours?**
   - Used geocoding to identify top-rated neighbors sorted by hygiene.

4. **Which Local Authorities have the most establishments with a hygiene score of 0?**
   - Aggregated poor hygiene ratings grouped by Local Authority.

Each question showcases the power of **NoSQL queries** and Python for insightful data analysis.
